## 🛠 Technical Details

This newsletter is built with:
- Pure HTML/CSS (no frameworks)
- Hosted on GoDaddy Managed WordPress (subfolder: `/ai-trendwatch/`)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Dark theme (#151617 background, #FAA1A1 accent)
- SEO and Schema.org structured data

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Automatic Deployment
Push to `main` branch triggers GitHub Actions workflow that deploys to GoDaddy via SFTP.

### Critical Path Configuration
```
SFTP uploads to: html/ai-trendwatch/
Web serves from: gtmhelix.com/ai-trendwatch/
```

### Image Naming Convention
All images must use exact filenames as listed in `images/` folder:
- `google-core-update-eeat-1280x680.jpg` (NOT google-dec-2025...)
- `anthropic-ai-cyber-espionage-1280x680.jpg` (NOT ai-cyber-espionage...)
- `openai-devday-agentkit-1280x680.jpg` (NOT openai-devday-2025...)
- `aaif-mcp-foundation-1280x680.jpg`
- `msft-azure-gb300-1280x680-1.jpg`

### Post-Deployment Checklist
1. ✅ Check GitHub Actions → "Deploy to GoDaddy" succeeded
2. ✅ Go to GoDaddy → Settings → Flush Cache
3. ✅ Wait 5-15 minutes for CDN propagation
4. ✅ Test in Incognito + Hard Refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Troubleshooting
- **Files not updating**: Verify `deploy.yml` uses `cd html/ai-trendwatch` (NOT just `ai-trendwatch`)
- **Images broken**: Check exact filename match in `images/` folder
- **Caching issues**: Add `?v=timestamp` to URL for testing

## 📝 Lessons Learned (RCA)

| Issue | Root Cause | Prevention |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Deploy succeeds but files not updating | Wrong SFTP path (`ai-trendwatch/` vs `html/ai-trendwatch/`) | Always verify path in deploy.yml |
| Broken images | Filename mismatch in HTML vs actual files | Use exact filenames from images/ folder |
| Old design showing after deploy | CDN caching | Always flush GoDaddy cache after deploy |
| Redirect loops on issue pages | Migration created redirect stubs | Never use redirect stubs, always full content |
| Light mode CSS incomplete | `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)` missing some CSS classes | Add ALL CSS classes to light mode override, especially `.tech-*`, `.mini-*`, `.category-header` |
| Email form goes to wrong newsletter | Google Reader Revenue Manager `isPartOfProductId` linked to wrong publication | Update in Google Publisher Center admin console |

### Google Reader Revenue Manager Configuration
The email signup uses Google Reader Revenue Manager. The `isPartOfProductId` in `newsletter-signup.html` must match your Google Publisher Center publication:
```javascript
isPartOfProductId: "CAow6-rBDA:openaccess"  // Update this in Google Publisher Center
```
To change the linked publication, update your settings at [Google Publisher Center](https://publishercenter.google.com/).
